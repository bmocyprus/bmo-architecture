# BMO Architecture References

This repository contains reference architectures and infrastructure design patterns used by BMO Cyprus to support complex IT and OT environments.

The material focuses on structure zoning and decision logic rather than vendor specific implementations.

## Scope
- IT infrastructure and hybrid cloud architectures
- OT ICS and IoT environments
- Network segmentation and security zoning
- Identity aware access boundaries
- Critical systems dependency mapping
- Resilience and continuity driven design

## Architectural Focus
The architectures documented here prioritize.
- Clear separation of trust zones
- Deterministic traffic flows
- Operational safety and availability
- Security controls aligned with real operational constraints
- Long term maintainability over short term optimization

## Usage
All content is provided as reference material.
Architectures are illustrative and must be adapted to specific operational regulatory and risk contexts.

## Notes
No client specific information is included.
Diagrams and examples are anonymized.
This repository does not provide turnkey solutions.
